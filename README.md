# Getting Started With CampFinderCO (Backend)

CampFinderCO was created to allow campers from Colorado and around the country to discover, submit, and review dispersed or backcountry campsites. Feel free to check it out and let me know what you think!

The following steps are to set up and get started with the backend of the project.

# Git Clone

> Go to:  https://github.com/andrrowens/camp-finder-backend

Next, click on the green <>Code button. A dropdown should appear.

Next, open up your terminal and navigate to the directory where you would like to clone CampFinderCO's backend.

Then type: 

> git clone

Then paste the copied SSH key from GitHub by right clicking or pressing command + v (Mac users) or ctrl + v (Windows users).

Once the SSH key is pasted press enter.

Then type:

> ls

Find the file "camp-finder-backend"

Then navigate into the project directory typing:

> cd camp-finder-backend


Then type:

> code .

This will open up the project repository in VSCode.

Inside your terminal in VScode we'll want to start the server by typing:

> rails s

This will start our backend API.
